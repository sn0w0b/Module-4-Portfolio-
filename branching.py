# A time traveler has suddenly appeared in your classroom!

# Create a variable representing the traveler's
# year of origin (e.g., year = 2000)
# and greet our strange visitor with a different message
# if he is from the distant past (before 1900),
# the present era (1900-2020) or from the far future (beyond 2020).

#changed the quotations./ this code has some syntax error addded the correct parantheses
year = int(input("Greetings! What is your year of origin? ")) 
#change to the correct syntax for if, elif and else added : at the end
if year < 1900:
    print ("Woah, that's the past!")
elif year > 1900 and year < 2020: #changed && to and
    print ("That's totally the present!")
else:
    print ("Far out, that's the future!!")
